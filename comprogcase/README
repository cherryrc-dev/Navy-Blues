Code explanation

This repository includes a small Student Grade Management GUI application.

Overview

StudentGradeFrame.java is the main graphical application window. It keeps a
list of Student objects and arranges controls that let a user add, view, find,
modify, or remove students.
Student Grade Management — README

This project contains a small GUI application that manages student records.

Overview

StudentGradeFrame.java acts as the main application window. It keeps a list
of Student objects and exposes controls that let a user add, view, locate,
change, or remove records.

Student model

A Student stores a full name and numeric grades in math, science, and English.
Helper methods compute the average of those three values and indicate whether
the student passes (average at least 75) or fails.

User interface

Six primary controls appear in the window: Add Student, Show All Students,
Search Student, Edit Student, Delete Student, and Exit. Each control triggers
an action that modifies or queries the stored data.

How data moves through the app

User interactions trigger event handlers that update or query the student
list. Adding creates a new record; showing displays the collection in a
scrollable view; searching locates a record by name; editing updates fields;
deleting removes a record.

Key concepts used

• Object-orientation — classes group data and behavior.
• Event-driven UI — button actions run handler code in response to user
	activity.
• Collections — a list holds Student records and supports add/remove/update.

Summary

This learning example demonstrates GUI layout, event handling, and runtime
collection management using Java Swing.
